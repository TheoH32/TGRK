# The FRQ

![problemPart1](assets/images/theoFRQ/problem.png)

## Understanding the situation
"public static final int MAX = /*value not shown*/;" means that the interger value (which is not given as its not relevant to the solution) is public to other classes and is a constant. We know it is a constant by "final" which means that the value cannot be changed. "MAX" means that it is a maxium value that will be referenced later on in the code.

"private int[][] grid;". Starting from "private", this means that the variable "grid" is only accessible within the class it is declared in. "int[][]" means that the variable "grid" is a 2D array of integers. "grid" is the name of the variable. Typically "int[][]" is defined by numbers like "int[3][3];" which means that the 2D array "grid" has 3 rows and 3 columns. However, in this case, the size of the 2D array is not given as that is part of our assignment.

"public void repopulate()" is what our task is. "public" means that the method "repopulate()" is accessible to other classes. "void" means that the method "repopulate()" does not return a value. "repopulate()" is the name of the method. Our task is to write the code for the method that fills the grid with random integers between 1 and MAX inclusive.

## Unstanding the situation
"public int countIncreasingCols()" is a method that we are tasked to code. It should return the number of cloumns in the "grid" variable that are in increasing order. For example, if the "grid" variable is {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, then the method should return 3 as all the columns are in increasing order. If the "grid" variable is {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {9, 8, 7}}, then the method should return 2 as only the first two columns are in increasing order.


```Java
public class Data {
    public static final int MAX = //random number;
    public int [][] grid;
}
```

```Java
// public means it can be called on throughout the program
// void means it will not return anything
public void repopulate() {
    // purpose: repopulate the grid with random values
    // code below traverse the grid and repopulates each cell
    for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
            // rval is an integer in the range [1, MAX]
            int rval = (int) (Math.random() * MAX) + 1;
            
            // Ensure rval is divisible by 10 but not divisible by 100
            while (rval % 10 != 0 || rval % 100 == 0) {
                rval = (int) (Math.random() * MAX) + 1;
            }
            
            // assign rval to the current cell
            grid[row][col] = rval;
        }
    }
}

```

```Java
// public means it can be called on throughout the program
// int in the method means that it will return an integer
public int countIncreasingCols() {
    // purpose: count the number of columns that are increasing

    // count is set to 0
    int count = 0;
    // this loop traverses the columns
    for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
        // ordered is set to true by default, but will be set to false if the column is not ordered
        boolean ordered = true;
        // catching the error if the column is not ordered
        for (int row = 1; row < grid.length; row++) {
            if (grid[row][col] < grid[row - 1][col]) {
                // set to false
                ordered = false;
            }
        }
        // if there is no error, boolen stays true and count adds 1
        if (ordered) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    // returns the count
    return count;
}
```

# Result


```Java
public class Data {
    // PROVIDED CODE
    // I put 100 there bc code would give error if I didn't, however follow the instructions and assume it has no value
    public static final int MAX = 100;
    public int [][] grid;
