### Here is the list of the unit 2 hacks.
Note: This is due __Monday__! Write your hacks in a Jupyter Notebook and then DM them to us over slack by Monday Morning at 8:00 AM. For full credit, all criteria in the hacks must be completed and show some originality. 

## Hack 1: (0.25)
Create a void method that takes an integer input and adds it to an ArrayList. Then, add a non-void method that is able to call a certain index from the ArrayList.

## Hack 2: (0.25)
Create a simple guessing game with random numbers in math, except the random number is taken to a random exponent (also includes roots), and the person has to find out what the root and exponent is (with hints!). Use at least one static and one non-static method in your class.

## Hack 3: (0.25)
Create a class of your choosing that has multiple parameters of different types (int, boolean, String, double) and put 5 data values in that list. Show that you can access the information by givng some samples.


## Hack 4: (0.25)
Using your preliminary knowlege of loops, use a for loop to iterate through a person's first and last name, seperated by a space, and create methods to call a person's first name and a person's last name by iterating through the string.
